# Calculator Specifications

## 1. User Interface

- The calculator should have a simple command-line interface.
- Display a menu with options for different operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exit).
- Prompt the user to enter the desired operation.

## 2. Input

- Take user input for two numbers on which the operation will be performed.
- Handle different data types (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers).

## 3. Operations

- Implement basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Ensure that division by zero is handled gracefully (display an error message).

## 4. Output

- Display the result of the chosen operation.
- Format the output appropriately (e.g., show decimal places for floating-point results).

## 5. User Interaction

- Allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
- Provide an option to exit the calculator.

## 6. Error Handling

- Validate user input to ensure it's a valid number.
- Display error messages for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input).

## 7. Code Structure

- Use functions to encapsulate different parts of the calculator logic (e.g., one function for each operation).
- Maintain clean and modular code with proper comments.

## 8. Additional Features (Optional)

- Allow the calculator to handle more advanced operations like square root, power, etc.
- Implement a memory feature where users can store and recall results.

## Example Workflow

1. Display the calculator menu.
2. Prompt the user to choose an operation (e.g., addition).
3. Take user input for two numbers.
4. Perform the selected operation.
5. Display the result.
6. Ask if the user wants to perform another calculation or exit.

Feel free to customize and expand on these specifications based on your preferences and the features you want to include in your calculator. This project is a great opportunity to practice basic input/output, conditional statements, and simple function implementation in C. Good luck with your coding!
